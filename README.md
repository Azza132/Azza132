## Profile

I am a self-directed developer focused on building practical software that solves real problems. Occasionally, I will build games.

My work is driven by necessity rather than trend. I build tools that I personally rely on in my day-to-day and professional life. If something creates friction, slows execution, or does not exist in the right form, I design and implement a solution.

The emphasis is always on clarity, reliability, and usefulness.

## Areas of Focus

### Personal Productivity Systems
Purpose-built tools designed to:
- Reduce cognitive load  
- Structure information effectively  
- Improve workflow efficiency  
- Support consistent execution  

These systems are tailored around my own working methods rather than generalized use cases.

### Professional Utilities
Applications built to a standard I would genuinely depend on:
- Practical and efficient  
- Minimal and focused  
- Refined beyond “just working”  

Every project begins with a real-world need.

### Languages
- **Python** — automation, scripting, data handling, application logic  
- **HTML** — clean, functional interfaces and browser-based tools  

I intentionally work within a focused stack to maintain depth, clarity, and execution speed.

## Development Methodology

### AI-Assisted Engineering

I incorporate AI tools directly into my development workflow:

- ChatGPT  
- Claude AI  

AI is used to:
- Accelerate iteration  
- Explore architectural options  
- Refine logic  
- Improve debugging efficiency  

Strategic decisions, system design, and final implementation direction remain fully human-led.

## Development Philosophy

```python
while problem_exists:
    identify_friction()
    design_solution()
    implement()
    refine_until_useful()
```

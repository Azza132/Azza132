Hi, I'm Aaron Sermon

I'm a self-directed developer who builds tools that solve real problems.

My projects are practical by design. Rather than building for trends or portfolios, I focus on software that I genuinely use in my day-to-day and professional life. If something slows me down, creates friction, or doesn't exist yet in quite the right form, I build it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What I Build:

Most of my work falls into one of two categories:
-- Personal productivity tools — applications that streamline how I work, organise information, and manage tasks. Things built around my specific workflow rather than a generalised use case.
-- Professional utilities — tools tailored to my professional life, built to a standard I'd actually want to use rather than something that merely gets the job done.
-- The common thread is usefulness. Every project starts with a genuine need.

How I Work
Languages & Technologies

Python — scripting, automation, data handling, and back-end logic
HTML / CSS / JavaScript — browser-based tools and interfaces
AI-assisted development — I work with AI software as part of my development process, using it to accelerate building, problem-solve, and iterate quickly.
